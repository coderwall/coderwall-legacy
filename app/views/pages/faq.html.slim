    h3 = link_to 'What are these pro tips all about?', '#', 'name' => 'describeprotips'
    p  Pro tips are an easy way to share and save interesting links, code, and ideas. Pro tips can be upvoted by the community, earning the author more geek cred and also raise the visibility of the pro tip for the community. You can also quickly retrieve pro tips you've shared from your profile.

    h3 = link_to 'How are pro tips organized?', '#', 'name' => 'trendingprotips'
    p  Pro tips are grouped into Networks. In networks, you'll notice that protips with more upvotes don't always appear on the top of the page. This is because our trending algorithm takes several things into account. Things that affect the placement of a pro tip include how old the pro tip is, the author's coderwall level, and the coderwall level of each member that upvotes the pro tip. The higher a member's level, the more weight their vote holds.

    h3 = link_to 'What is a network?', '#', 'name' => 'networks'
